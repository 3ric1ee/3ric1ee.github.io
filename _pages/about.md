<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

Welcome to my academic portfolio! I am Eric, **a** **mixologist**, **a** **chef**, **and a** **Ph.D. Candidate** at HKUST, under the guidance of [Prof. Pengyu Zhu](https://pengyuzhu.com/).

# 🎓 Research Interests
My research interest is deeply rooted in the intersection of urban policies, big data, and behavioral economics, with a particular focus on **electric vehicle** (EV) policies and **travel behavior**. In addition, I am also interested in the electric vehicle **overcapacity** issue and **disruptive technology governance**. For the past three years, my primary research has been on **pandemic-induced behavioral changes** and their **potential stickness** in a high density urban context. I hope to have the opportunity to interact with scholars who share the same research interests!

# 🔥 News
- *2025.07*: &nbsp;🎉🎉 I have presented my research titled "Policy Recommendations: Convergence or Divergence? Analyzing Academic Research in Transportation Using LLM and Computational Social Science" in the panel "Putting policy diffusion in process" of the at the 7th International Conference on Public Policy (ICPPP7), Chiang Mai 2025. This study constructs a scalable measure of policy recommendation convergence/ divergence in academic papers; and explores the extent of convergence/ divergence within the context of electric vehicle (EV) research in the transportation field. 
- *2025.03*: &nbsp;🎉🎉 The paper **"Pandemic-era behavioral changes and post-pandemic persistence in the high-density urban context of Hong Kong"** co-authored with Prof. Zhu, Yuqing and Jeff has been accepted by *CITIES*. We assess how the pandemic has modified the behaviors of Hong Kong's residents and the durability of these changes, by undertaking a demographically representative survey from June to September 2022, with a subsequent follow-up in August 2023. Our findings reveal several pandemic-induced behavioral trends that diverge from existing literature, offering new insights into behavioral change and its persistence. These insights contribute to a deeper understanding of emerging norms in the post-pandemic era and enhance preparedness for future public health challenges.
- *2025.01*: &nbsp;🎉🎉 The paper **"Analyzing Determinants of Traffic Violations in a Multi-Cultural Setting: Case of Abu Dhabi"** co-authored with Prof. Praveen Maghelal and Prof. Pengyu Zhu has been accepted by *Journal of Urban Management*. We examined traffic violations in a multicultural context and found that drivers with switching driving licences (without domestic driving test) had a lower frequency of traffic violations.We provide a rationale for adopting a more open driving licence policy in a multicultural city.
- *2025.01*: &nbsp;One of my most respected professors, Donald LOW, just published his new book "The Price of Zero", an anthology of essays on the Chinese economy examines the causes and economic consequences of the zero-Covid policy that China pursued during the pandemic [Link to know more](https://thepriceofzero.org/) .
- *2024.09*: &nbsp;My Office has been relocated to Office C (Room 4336, lift 13-15, HKUST). Welcome~

- Conduct a HKPSSD- based survey on the behavioral changes in Post-Pandemic Hong Kong. Lead in the data collection and data cleansing process. Then, use data collected via the HKPSSD-based survey and structural equation modeling (SEM) to identify the causal relationships between COVID-19 risks.
- To investigate the direct and indirect effects of COVID-19 on a range of behavioral changes and to understand the role of four major intervening variables, namely access to technology, economic circumstances, stress, and attitudes and values.
