<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

Welcome to my academic portfolio! I am Eric, **a** **mixologist**, **a** **chef**, **and a** **Ph.D. student** at HKUST, under the guidance of [Prof. Pengyu Zhu](https://pengyuzhu.com/).

# 🎓 Research Interests
My research interest is deeply rooted in the intersection of urban policies, big data, and behavioral economics, with a particular focus on **electric vehicle** (EV) policies and **travel behavior**. In addition, I am also interested in the electric vehicle **overcapacity** issue. For the past two years, my primary research has been on **pandemic-induced behavioral changes** and their **potential stickness** in a high density urban context. I am now researching how the development of China's electric vehicle industry will affect the daily travel behavior of rural and suburban residents in the future. I hope to have the opportunity to interact with scholars who share the same research interests!
